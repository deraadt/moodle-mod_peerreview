<p><em>Well written criteria are the key to a successful Peer review activity.</em></p>
<p><strong>Criteria should be...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective</strong><br />
Criteria should be <em>objective</em> rather than <em>subjective</em>. They should be used to test the presence or correctness of a feature in a student\'s submission. They should not be used to ask students to make a judgement of quality. Evaluations made by students (even Masters students) are not consistent when students are asked to make subjective judgements.</li>
<br />
<li><strong>Concise</strong><br />
Students should be able to evaluate the work of another student, even if they themselves have not reached that standard. This means you should provide instructions on how to test the criteria.</li>
<br />
<li><strong>Binary</strong><br />
<em>Remember, these criteria are for students, not teachers.</em> If at first thought a scale is desired, ask yourself how you would define the levels of that scale; ask "what differentiates the levels?" Then ask: "what level is desirable?" Setting a binary criterion at the desired level drives students to accomplish that level. If you want to offer reward for a partially correct response, or a superior response, divide that criterion into finer grained criteria that are more specific. Binary criteria are makes objective evaluation possible for students. Using a binary rubric also sets a definitive standard, which can inturn encourage greater retention and better student outcomes. Students appreciate removing the "guess-work"; binary criteria make work "achievable".</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hidden Answers</strong></p>
<p>The criteria are shown to students with the activity description, even before they submit.</p>
<p>An optional additional alternate text can be provided for each criterion. This second text appears during and after reviewing. This allows you to create criteria with specific answers or tests that are not shown to the students before they submit.</p>
<p><strong>More Complex Criteria Text</strong></p>
<p>Criteria can be simple short pieces of text, or more complex. If you know how to write in HTML, this can help you to create criteria with structure and formatting. For example, tags such as <code>&lt;strong&gt;...&lt;/strong&gt;</code> can be placed around text to make it <strong>strong</strong>, <code>&lt;em&gt;...&lt;/em&gt;</code> tags for <em>emphasis</em>, a singleton <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> tag can be used to include a line break, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Criterion Values</strong></p>
<p>The values for all criteria, plus the reward students receive for completing reviews, should sum to the Grade value for the activity. The system attempts to enforce correct addition. Guidance is provided at the bottom of the Criteria page.</p>
<h1>Examples of Criteria</h1>
<p>The following are good examples are objective, concise, binary criteria. (HTML tags have been used to bolden text and insert line-breaks.)</p>

<p>The chain of review relationships can continue indefinitely after this point in time.</p>

<ul>
    <li>All students are expected to complete two reviews (usually with the incentive of marks).</li>

    Students can only submit once. If they submit the wrong file, a teacher can submit the correct file for them. Resubmitting removes the original submission and replaces it with a new file. Resubmitting does not change any other details about the student\'s submission, or their reviews, or reviews they have received. If resubmission is done after reviews have been made, the teacher may have to complete a moderation review as peer reviews of this student will be based on their original submission. Be wary when resubmitting  a student\'s submission after they have completed reviews. If they have, they will have seen other students\' submissions. Make a policy to accept resubmissions only if the student has not completed reviews, unless you implicitly trust the student.</li>

<p>A Moderation Target allows a Teacher to set targets for themselves at different points during the course. For example, if there are six Peer review activities, it may be prudent to set a target of 1 moderation at the second activity, 2 at the fourth and 3 at the sixth. Students then get a sense that the Teacher is overseeing the review process. Top students are usually easy to moderate, so this creates little additional work.</p>
